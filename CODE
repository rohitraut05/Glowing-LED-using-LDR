/*
  AnalogReadSerial

  Reads an analog input on pin 0, prints the result to the Serial Monitor.
  Graphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).
  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.

  This example code is in the public domain.

int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;
int sensor = A0;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);

  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input on analog pin 0:
  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
   brightness = brightness + fadeAmount;
        
if (brightness <= 0 || brightness >= 255) {
    fadeAmount = +fadeAmount;
  }// Condition to make LED ON.
  brightness = map(sensorValue, 0, 800, 255,0); // Converting LDR to LED Brightness.
  analogWrite(led, brightness);
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
